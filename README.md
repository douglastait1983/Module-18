# Project Title: PyChain Ledger
This project is part of Module 18 (Blockchain) of Fintech Course. 

# Project Description
As a fintech engineer working at one of the five largest banks in the world. I have been recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. My task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Scope of Works
Update the Python file, which contains the basic `PyChain` ledger structure that you created throughout the module:

1. Create a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

2. Modify the existing `Block` data class to store `Record` data.

3. Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit interface.

4. Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.

# How to run PyChain Ledger
Streamlit will be used to illustrate the PyChain ledger. To launch this application, run the python code with 'streamlit run pychain.py'. Please refer to the library to ensure that the right libraries are installed. 

To test the ledger, enter the values for the sender, receiver and amount, and then click the "Add Block" button. Test the validity of the blockchain.
